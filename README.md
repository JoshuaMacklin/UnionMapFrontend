# Union Mapper

This application was built in order to help others shop more ethically. 

After being surprised by the quality of products, low prices, and overall sustainability by the local Union shops in my area, I wanted to build an app that could help them and  others with visibility.

[Backend](https://github.com/JoshuaMacklin/UnionMapBackend)

Built with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, ReactJS, Geoapify, & Leaflet
